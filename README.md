## 4. Observations & Key Findings

- Steady-State Behavior: [Describe whether the motor reached expected final speed]
- Rise Time Analysis: Not accurately measurable due to sampling limitations.
- Noise & Filtering: [Describe filter effectiveness and any distortions]
- Unexpected Behavior: Observed faster rise times with lower gains, suggesting possible system non-linearity.

## 5. Challenges & Limitations

- Limited Sampling Rate: 100 Hz is too low for precise transient analysis.
- Voltage Drop in L298: May be affecting torque and acceleration.
- Sensor Noise: Requires filtering, but filtering may impact transient accuracy.

## 6. Future Improvements

- Use a higher-frequency sampling system for transient analysis.
- Test with a MOSFET-based motor driver to reduce voltage drop.
- Compare performance with alternative filtering techniques.
- Investigate the unexpected rise time behavior by modeling system dynamics.

## 7. Conclusion

The experiment provided insights into the motorâ€™s steady-state behavior and filtering effectiveness. However, limitations in sampling rate and motor driver performance affected rise time analysis. Future work will focus on improving hardware and software to obtain more accurate system dynamics.
